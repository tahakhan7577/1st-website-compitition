                  <p class="card-text">
                    Financial Action Task Force (FATF) held its June plenary session in which it acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to curb money laundering and terrorism financing. It further stated that Pakistan has fulfilled its two action plans, covering a total of 34, and that FATF will conduct an on-site visit to assess the implementation of the policy measures after which Pakistan’s name will be taken off the grey list. Political parties in Pakistan have started celebrating this decision and every party is claiming the credit for this success.

                  <h3>Ch Pervaiz Elahi As CM Punjab: PTI’s Rare Bad Move</h3>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    What had happened in July in the house of Punjab assembly was just another episode of the ongoing drama series of Pakistan’s political turmoil. Until now, this series contains the ouster of the then prime minister Imran khan; his replacement by Shahbaz Sharif; the resignation of the then chief minister of Punjab Usman Buzdar; his replacement by Hamza Shahbaz, and the entry of Ch Pervaiz Elahi as new chief minister of Punjab. The most interesting among all is the selection of Ch Pervaiz Elahi as the chief minister of Punjab. He was in the office as chief minister of Punjab during the Pervaiz Musharraf era. His selection as the CM of Punjab has raised the eyebrows of many. PTI is the biggest party in Pakistan and Punjab but despite having 178 members in the Punjab assembly had to knee down in the favor of Ch Pervaiz Elahi who had only ten members. So, what forced PTI to do that?

                  <h3>Is Imran Khan Becoming Machiavelli’s Prince?</h3>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    One might read Machiavelli’s Prince and find it quite familiar to the political strategies of Imran Khan in the current political turmoil. Who could’ve known that Khan is following the footsteps of Niccole Machiavelli in order to become an “ideal leader”. ‘The Prince’ is a book written by a political scientist named Niccole Machiavelli in the 16th Century. It won’t be wrong to say, The Prince is one of the finest books on politics and governance and scholars of political science are not alien to the book in any manner. It is as popular as Plato’s Republic, but bearing in mind, being popular does not in any way mean it must be followed in practical life. Imran Khan’s politics is often criticized by political commentators, analysts and of course his political opponents, but observing Imran Khan from an objective and neutral lens might give it a whole different perspective and one may realize we might be dealing with someone even more lethal than we expected. One who has read The Prince will most definitely see the similarities between Machiavelli’s advice to the prince and Imran Khan’s meticulous and sometimes nefarious political agendas.
